A Gameserver launcher written in C# . 
This project aims to help people not as experienced with Unturned or computers in general.
It is so easy to use in fact, that just pressing enter while having steam installed in the default directory will launch a server without you knowing anything you did.

I mainly work on it in my free time, if you want to push or contribute feel free to contact me!
